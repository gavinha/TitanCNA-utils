=========== REAMDE.txt ==========
This help file contains instructions for generating the spike-in as used in the manuscript:
Ha, G. et al. TITAN: inference of copy number architectures in clonal cell populations from tumor whole-genome sequence data. Genome Res. 24, 1881â€“1893 (2014).

=========== Usage of createSpikeInSample.R ============
This script will generate a full sample, containing 23 chromosomes, with spike-ins for 4 chromosomes originating from specified regions of loss and gain.

R --vanilla --args [file_list.txt] [regions.txt] [numEvents] [output_dir] < createSpikeInSample.R


===========  file_list.txt ===========
File with 3-column tab-delimited format:
1) ID, 2) Log ratio filename, 3) Allelic ratio filename
See below for example formats for each type of file

Example:
DG1136a_tum100	DG1136a_gcMapCor.reads	DG1136a.txt
DG1136a_tum60-norm40	DG1136a_tum60-norm40_gcMapCor.reads	DG1136a_tum60-norm40.txt
DG1136a_tum80-norm20	DG1136a_tum80-norm40_gcMapCor.reads	DG1136a_tum80-norm40.txt

===========  regions.txt ===========
Type	Chr	Start	Stop
DEL	16	46464733	90173515
AMP	8	97045605	144155272

Note that the simulated events will only be inserted into these chromosomes: 1,2,9,18
To change this, you need to modify the R script in line 103
chrs <- c(1,2,9,18)

===========  numEvents ===========
The number of events for each of DEL and AMP and for each mixture (see file_list.txt)
For the TITAN manuscript, 4 was used for this argument.
Note that the large (10kb) events only have 1 event.

sampleSize <- c(rep(10,numEvents),rep(100,numEvents),rep(1000,numEvents),rep(10000,1))



========= DG1136a_tum60-norm40_gcMapCor.reads ========
This is basically a tab-delimited version of the wig file but with the computed logR (tumour/normal).

chr     start   end     logR
1       1       1000    NA
1       1001    2000    NA
1       2001    3000    NA

========= DG1136a_tum60-norm40.txt =========
This file is the allele counts input file that is in the format specified for TITAN.

1       1002   G       6       C       7
